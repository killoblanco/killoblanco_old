Hi, my name is Kamilo Vasquez and I am a software developer with experience since 2010. I am passionate about creating software solutions that have a positive impact on people's lives.

I have worked on international teams on large-scale projects and have performed various roles in web development. In addition, I have experience in other areas of development such as mobile applications, desktop applications, and WebAssembly. I am a self-taught learner and am very interested in Artificial Intelligence.

I am currently only available for job opportunities that require relocation. I am looking for opportunities abroad where I can apply my skills and knowledge to contribute to a company's success. I am willing to adapt to new cultures and workplace challenges.

If you are looking for a highly skilled and motivated professional to join your team, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am looking forward to the opportunity to speak with you and discuss how I can help your company achieve its goals.
